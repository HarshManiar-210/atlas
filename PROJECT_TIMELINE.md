- [ ] **Day 1 (2 hours):** Set up Next.js project structure, TypeScript configuration, and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] **Day 2 (2 hours):** Install and configure all dependencies (Zustand, TanStack Query, Socket.IO, React-Grid-Layout, Recharts, React Hook Form, Zod)

### Day 3-4: Core Architecture (4 hours)

- [ ] **Day 3 (2 hours):** Set up state management architecture (Zustand stores, TanStack Query setup)
- [ ] **Day 4 (2 hours):** Implement basic dashboard layout with React-Grid-Layout

### Day 5-7: Real-Time Collaboration (6 hours)

- [ ] **Day 5 (2 hours):** Set up Socket.IO client and basic WebSocket connection
- [ ] **Day 6 (2 hours):** Implement real-time cursor tracking
- [ ] **Day 7 (2 hours):** Add presence indicators and user avatars

## Week 2: Features & Polish

### Day 8-9: Widget System (4 hours)

- [ ] **Day 8 (2 hours):** Create widget gallery and basic widget components
- [ ] **Day 9 (2 hours):** Implement drag-and-drop functionality for widgets

### Day 10-11: Charts & Data (4 hours)

- [ ] **Day 10 (2 hours):** Implement chart components (Line, Bar, Pie, Data Table, KPI cards)
- [ ] **Day 11 (2 hours):** Add CSV upload and REST API data connectivity

### Day 12-13: Configuration & Export (4 hours)

- [ ] **Day 12 (2 hours):** Build widget configuration modal with forms
- [ ] **Day 13 (2 hours):** Implement export functionality (PNG/PDF)

### Day 14: Final Polish (2 hours)

- [ ] **Day 14 (2 hours):** Performance optimization, accessibility features, testing, and final bug fixes

## Daily Breakdown (2 hours each)

### Week 1 Focus Areas:

1. **Project Foundation** - Get the basic structure in place
2. **Real-Time Infrastructure** - WebSocket setup and basic collaboration
3. **Core Dashboard** - Grid layout and basic functionality

### Week 2 Focus Areas:

1. **Widget System** - Interactive components and drag-and-drop
2. **Data Integration** - Charts and data sources
3. **Advanced Features** - Configuration, export, and polish

## Key Milestones

### End of Week 1:

- ✅ Basic dashboard with grid layout
- ✅ Real-time cursor tracking
- ✅ User presence indicators
- ✅ WebSocket communication working

### End of Week 2:

- ✅ Complete widget system with all chart types
- ✅ Data connectivity (CSV + REST APIs)
- ✅ Widget configuration modals
- ✅ Export functionality
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Accessibility features
- ✅ Basic testing coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges:

1. **WebSocket Complexity** - Start with basic implementation, add features incrementally
2. **Performance Issues** - Implement memoization and lazy loading early
3. **State Management** - Keep state simple, use appropriate tools for each use case
4. **Time Constraints** - Focus on core features first, polish later

### Contingency Plans:

- If behind schedule, prioritize core collaboration features over advanced chart types
- Use mock data initially to speed up development
- Implement basic versions first, enhance later

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

- [ ] Multi-user real-time collaboration
- [ ] Basic dashboard with draggable widgets
- [ ] At least 3 chart types (Line, Bar, Pie)
- [ ] CSV data upload
- [ ] Basic widget configuration

### Stretch Goals (if time permits):

- [ ] PDF export
- [ ] Advanced chart types
- [ ] Database persistence
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Advanced accessibility features

## Daily Workflow

### Each 2-hour session should include:

1. **Planning (10 minutes):** Review goals for the session
2. **Development (90 minutes):** Focused coding time
3. **Testing (15 minutes):** Test new features
4. **Documentation (5 minutes):** Update progress and notes

### Time Management Tips:

- Use Pomodoro technique (25-minute focused sessions)
- Minimize distractions during development time
- Test frequently to catch issues early
- Keep commits small and focused
- Document decisions and progress

## Tools & Resources

### Development Tools:

- VS Code with React/TypeScript extensions
- Browser DevTools for debugging
- Git for version control
- npm/yarn for package management

### Key Documentation:

- Next.js App Router docs
- Zustand documentation
- TanStack Query docs
- Socket.IO client docs
- Recharts documentation

**Remember:** This is an ambitious project for 28 hours. Focus on core functionality first, then add polish. The goal is to demonstrate real-time collaboration and modern React patterns, not to build every possible feature.

# Open Source Development Best Practices

## Branch Management & Git Workflow

### 1. Branch Naming Conventions

#### Feature Branches

```bash
# Format: feature/description-of-feature
feature/real-time-cursor-tracking
feature/widget-configuration-modal
feature/csv-data-upload
feature/export-functionality
```

#### Bug Fix Branches

```bash
# Format: fix/description-of-bug
fix/websocket-connection-issues
fix/memory-leak-in-charts
fix/drag-drop-performance
```

#### Hotfix Branches

```bash
# Format: hotfix/critical-issue-description
hotfix/security-vulnerability
hotfix/critical-crash-fix
```

#### Documentation Branches

```bash
# Format: docs/description-of-docs
docs/api-documentation
docs/setup-guide
docs/contributing-guidelines
```

### 2. Branch Creation Best Practices

#### Before Creating a Branch:

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main and it's up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Push the branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Branch Size Guidelines:

- **Small branches:** 1-3 commits, focused on single feature
- **Medium branches:** 4-10 commits, related features grouped together
- **Avoid large branches:** >20 commits, split into smaller branches

### 3. Commit Message Standards

#### Conventional Commits Format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Examples:

```bash
# Feature commits
feat(websocket): add real-time cursor tracking
feat(charts): implement line chart component
feat(ui): add widget configuration modal

# Bug fixes
fix(performance): resolve memory leak in chart rendering
fix(websocket): handle connection drops gracefully
fix(accessibility): improve screen reader support

# Documentation
docs(readme): update installation instructions
docs(api): add WebSocket event documentation

# Refactoring
refactor(state): simplify Zustand store structure
refactor(components): extract reusable chart wrapper

# Performance
perf(charts): optimize re-rendering with memoization
perf(websocket): throttle cursor position updates

# Tests
test(components): add unit tests for chart components
test(integration): add WebSocket connection tests
```

### 4. Pull Request Best Practices

#### PR Title Format:

```
[Type] Brief description of changes

Examples:
[Feature] Add real-time cursor tracking
[Bug Fix] Resolve WebSocket connection issues
[Performance] Optimize chart rendering
[Docs] Update API documentation
```

#### PR Description Template:

```markdown

### 5. Code Review Guidelines

#### For Contributors:

- **Self-review first:** Review your own PR before requesting review
- **Small, focused PRs:** Easier to review and less likely to introduce bugs
- **Clear descriptions:** Help reviewers understand the changes
- **Test thoroughly:** Ensure all functionality works as expected
- **Update documentation:** Keep docs in sync with code changes

#### For Reviewers:

- **Be constructive:** Provide helpful feedback, not just criticism
- **Focus on code quality:** Logic, performance, security, maintainability
- **Check for edge cases:** Consider error handling and boundary conditions
- **Verify tests:** Ensure adequate test coverage
- **Consider accessibility:** Check for a11y compliance

### 6. Repository Structure Best Practices

#### Recommended Structure:

```

```

### 7. Issue Management

#### Issue Labels:

```yaml
# Priority
priority: high
priority: medium
priority: low

# Type
type: bug
type: feature
type: enhancement
type: documentation
type: question

# Status
status: needs-triage
status: in-progress
status: blocked
status: ready-for-review

# Component

component: ui
component: performance
```

#### Issue Templates:

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` files for:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Documentation issues
- Performance issues

### 8. Release Management

#### Semantic Versioning:

```

```

#### Release Process:

1. **Create release branch:** `release/v1.1.0`
2. **Update version numbers**
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
4. **Create PR to main**
5. **Tag release:** `git tag v1.1.0`
6. **Create GitHub release**

### 9. Documentation Standards

#### README.md Structure:

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description

## Features

```

#### Code Documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Handles real-time cursor tracking for collaborative features
 * @param userId - Unique identifier for the user
 * @param position - Current cursor position {x, y}
 * @param dashboardId - ID of the dashboard being viewed
 */
export const trackCursor = (
  userId: string,
  position: CursorPosition,
  dashboardId: string
) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### 10. Security Best Practices

#### Before Merging:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Input validation on all user data

- [ ] No console.log statements with sensitive data

#### Security Checklist:

- [ ] Sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Validate file uploads
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all external requests
- [ ] Implement proper CORS policies
- [ ] Regular dependency audits

### 11. Performance Considerations

#### Before Merging:

- [ ] Bundle size impact assessed
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Proper cleanup of event listeners
- [ ] Efficient re-rendering patterns
- [ ] Lazy loading where appropriate

### 12. Community Guidelines

#### Code of Conduct:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help newcomers learn
- Follow the project's coding standards
- Respect maintainers' decisions

#### Communication:

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Provide context in PR descriptions
